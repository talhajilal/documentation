#Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>


The activities and process objectives of the Release and Deployment Management process in ITIL V3 are mostly identical to Release Management in ITIL V2. ITIL V3 Release Management provides considerably more details in the areas of Release planning and testing; this led to the addition of two dedicated processes which were subsumed under Release Management in the previous ITIL version: Project Management - Transition Planning and Support, and Service Validation and Testing.

Release notes are documents that are distributed with software products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a beta release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released.
